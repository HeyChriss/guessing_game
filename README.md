# Overview

This is my first attempt to use Rust programming language, and this was the first time tryint to learn a functional language. 
It was a great experience to learn this language and read along some tutorials to create a simple program in Rust. 

To start using Rust I did a simple guessing game and the purpose of this game is to find out what ramdom number was given from the computer. 
This is also awesome because we can use this code to guess words too. This is my first program in Rust and I was able to learn basic things for
the future.

# Development Environment

To setup your development environment complete the following:

* Install Rust.

* Visual Studio Code has support for Rust. The Rust extension can be installed in Visual Studio Code. The cargo build tool can be run from the terminal.

* Follow chapter 1 of the Rust Programming Language Book for step by step instructions for building a Hello World application using the cargo tool.

The Rust language is used for embedded and application development. While similair to C or C++, it has improvements including memory management and variable ownership.
Support is provided for object-oriented methodologies as well as data structures and threading. Rust comes with a build environment called Cargo which is used both for library management and building.

Rust is a low-level programming language with direct access to hardware and memory, which makes it a great solution for embedded and bare-metal development.
You can use Rust to write operation systems or microcontroller applications. In fact, there are a number of operating systems written in Rust like: Redox, intermezzOS, QuiltOS, Rux, and Tock. Mozilla,
where the language was originally designed, uses it in its browser engines.

# Future Work

list of things that I need to fix, improve, and add in the future.
* Better understanding of functions and syntax in Rust. 
* Look for better ways to understand Rust. There are many places to look for, but sometimes it is difficult to
understand the tutorials or to understand what is happening in the book sometimes, so some videos will be great. 
* I want to add more features for my guessing game, like a menu or time.
